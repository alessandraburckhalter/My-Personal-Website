      <p>I have many loves in life, but today I want to talk about one of my first loves: Corinthians.<br/>Sport Club Corinthians Paulista better known as Corinthians, and by the nicknames "Timão" and "Coringão" is a Brazilian soccer team from the city of Sao Paulo.</p>

    <p> Corinthians is one of the most successful teams in Brazil and the Americas in recent years. Its traditional colors are white and black. Their fans are known as "Fiel" and their fans are estimated at approximately 30 million spread throughout Brazil and the world.</p>

    <p> As a passionate supporter, I tell you that being a Corinthians fan is something inexplicable. Corinthians fans do anything to follow Timão's games and can even cross the world to see their team on the field. In 2012, after the historic victory of Libertadores against Boca Juniors, Corinthians left for Japan to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup. About 30 thousand supporters accompanied the team to the Asian country. The party, however, started before that. Corinthians fans “invaded” Guarulhos Airport to accompany the team's boarding. If this isn't love, I don't know what it is. We love Corinthians and we are always there to support, no matter where it is.
